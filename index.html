      <div id="a"><p>Step 1: Models come out of the box connected to plastic supports called "sprues." Make a note of which pieces are for each model</p>

      <div id="d"><p>Step 4: Prime pieces with a flat paint color from a spray can (typically white, black, or grey)</p>

      <div id="e"><p>Step 5: Base coat model with primary color that will be used on finished product. This step is often done with a spray can but can be done with a brush for a virtually identical product</p>

      <div id="f"><p>Step 6: Paint fine details with paint brush. For this step it is smart to use a reference from a completed model to know which colors are appropriate.</p>

        <p>This step is much more complicated than described above. It is wise to watch a tutorial on how to paint such a model.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvLTEzts8-Y">Tutorial.</a></p>
